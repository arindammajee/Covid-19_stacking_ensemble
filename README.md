# Prediction of COVID-19 from Chest CT images using an Ensemble of Deep Learning Models

This repository is a part of reasearch conducted to establish an effective COVID-199prediction model through chest CT images using efficient Transfer Learning (TL) models. Initially,10we have used three standard Deep Learning (DL) models namely, VGG-16, ResNet50, and Xception11for the prediction of COVID-19. After that we have proposed a mechanism to ensemble the above12mentioned pre-trained models for the overall improvement of the prediction capability of the13system. The proposed model provides 98.9% classification accuracy and a high F1-score of 0.99 on the publicly available SaRS-CoV-2 CT dataset.
