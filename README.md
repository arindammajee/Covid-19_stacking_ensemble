# Prediction of COVID-19 from Chest CT images using an Ensemble of Deep Learning Models

This repository is a part of reasearch conducted to establish an effective COVID-19 prediction model through chest CT images using efficient Transfer Learning (TL) models. Initially,we have used three standard Deep Learning (DL) models namely, VGG-16, ResNet50, and Xception for the prediction of COVID-19. After that we have proposed a mechanism to ensemble the above mentioned pre-trained models for the overall improvement of the prediction capability of the system. The proposed model provides 98.79% classification accuracy and a high F1-score of 0.99 on the publicly available SaRS-CoV-2 CT dataset. This project is made possible under the guidance of Dr. Shibaprasad Sen, Prof. Dr. Ram Sarkar and Prof. Dr. Friedhelm Schwenker.List of contributors in this work are as follows:-
